# Intuition
The intuition for this problem is to traverse the binary tree from the root to each leaf node, and calculate the sum of all the root-to-leaf numbers. We can do this recursively by keeping track of the current sum as we traverse the tree, or iteratively using a stack to simulate the recursive process.

Intuition
The intuition for this problem is to traverse the binary tree from the root to each leaf node, and calculate the sum of all the root-to-leaf numbers. We can do this recursively by keeping track of the current sum as we traverse the tree, or iteratively using a stack to simulate the recursive process.

Approach
The recursive approach works as follows:

If the current node is null, return 0.
Update the current sum by multiplying it by 10 and adding the current node's value.
If the current node is a leaf node (i.e., has no left or right child), return the current sum.
Recursively call the function on the left and right subtrees, and return the sum of the results.
The iterative approach works as follows:

If the root is null, return 0.
Initialize a totalSum variable to 0 and a Stack to store the node and its current sum.
Push the root node and its value to the stack.
In a loop, pop the top element from the stack, get the node and its current sum.
If the current node is a leaf node, add the current sum to the totalSum.
Otherwise, push the right child (if it exists) and its updated sum to the stack, and then push the left child (if it exists) and its updated sum to the stack.
Return the totalSum.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(N)$$, where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as we visit each node exactly once.
- Space complexity:
Recursive solution: $$O(H)$$, where H is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursive call stack.
Iterative solution: $$O(H)$$, where H is the height of the binary tree, due to the stack used to store the nodes and their current sums.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;

private int sumNumbersRecursive(TreeNode node, int currentSum) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;

    currentSum = currentSum * 10 + node.val;

    if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {

    return sumNumbersRecursive(node.left, currentSum) +
           sumNumbersRecursive(node.right, currentSum);

```java
// Iterative solution
public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return 0;

    int totalSum = 0;
    Stack<Pair<TreeNode, Integer>> stack = new Stack<>();

    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        Pair<TreeNode, Integer> current = stack.pop();
        TreeNode node = current.getKey();
        int currentSum = current.getValue();

        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            totalSum += currentSum;
